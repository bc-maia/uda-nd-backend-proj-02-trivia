# API Reference: Udacitrivia

## Project
- This project is result of Udacity second project: **Udacitrivia**. This project is composed by two apps: A Python Flask API and a ReactJS frontend consuming the Questions API. This document aims on explaining and documenting API routes.

## Getting Started
Assuming the project is properly configured, and started, it will be running at:
- http://localhost:5000

## Making requests
As developer you can try those API requests using any tool able to make HTML requests, like curl or postman. In this case, if you're using VSCode with the [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) plugin, that can be used with the [requests.rest](./requests.rest) file in this repository, which will make testing the API simpler.

## Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return Four error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Not Processable
